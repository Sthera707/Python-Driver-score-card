GitHub README Summary:

Title: Driver Scorecard Project

Description:
This project focuses on creating a comprehensive driver scorecard to evaluate driver performance based on key metrics, including depot departure, customer TAT, and depot return. The code and analysis provided here can help businesses optimize their delivery operations and enhance driver efficiency.

Key Features:

Data Import and Preprocessing: The code imports and preprocesses data from a CSV file, handling missing values and data types.
Data Exploration: It identifies duplicates and missing values in the dataset for quality assessment.
Departure Time Variance Analysis: Calculates and categorizes departure time variances, providing insights into drivers' punctuality.
Depot Return Variance Analysis: Analyzes return times and categorizes variances, aiding in optimizing depot operations.
Customer TAT Variance Analysis: Evaluates customer turnaround times and categorizes variances to improve service quality.
Driver Performance Metrics: Computes driver-specific metrics, including percentages of return and TAT categories.
Visualizations: Generates histograms to visualize performance variances.
